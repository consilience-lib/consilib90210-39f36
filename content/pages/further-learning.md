    text: "## Learning Calendar\n\nWe have created a calendar full of events where you can learn more about the different areas of Token Engineering. This calendar will have events from multiple organisations and individuals in the Token Engineering community.\n\n\n\n## Longtail Financial Bootcamp\n\nLongtail Financial is working on a Token Engineering bootcamp, which starts with the Consilience Library. If you’d like to learn more about their bootcamp, join the Longtail Financial discord [here](https://discord.com/invite/FPHJfd2hAN).\n\n[Join the Longtail Financial Discord Server!](https://discord.com/invite/FPHJfd2hAN)\n\n## Token Engineering Academy\n\n### Degree\n\nToken Engineering Academy will be building the first bachelor-level education program and NFT-based certification, open job-boards and matchmaking activities for projects seeking Token Engineering expertise. Via this offering, they are defining standards for this new discipline. Additionally, NFT-based certification opens the door for new value flows in TE education and research.\n\nYou can read more on their proposal [here](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/te-fundamentals-te-academy/749):\n\n[TE Fundamentals (TE Academy)](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/te-fundamentals-te-academy/749)\n\nYou can join their AMA event happening on February 4, 2022 to learn more about this program. The event is [here](https://www.notion.so/TE-Fundamentals-AMA-with-TE-Commons-e9d48813648e4dd88a4e4aacf5ca9335):\n\n[TE Fundamentals AMA with TE Commons](https://www.notion.so/TE-Fundamentals-AMA-with-TE-Commons-e9d48813648e4dd88a4e4aacf5ca9335)\n\n### Academy\n\nThe Token Engineering Academy offers lectures, workshops, and seminars for anyone interested in this new, emerging field. They invite individuals and project teams to learn, collaborate, and put token engineering into practice. Please get in touch if you'd like to bring your team to TE Academy:\_<contact@tokenengineering.net>.\n\n[TokenEngineering Academy | Token Engineering](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-welcome)\n\n## Token Engineering Book\n\nA Hitchhiker's Guide to Token Engineering is a community-sourced and crowdfunded book and online content repo for token designers, entrepreneurs and applied researchers aimed at becoming a practical guide. Parts of it have already contributed to Token Engineering Academy's first course on Ecosystem Value Flows. Feel free to take part in live sessions around combination of Chapter contents as well as provide feedback that will help shape the first and follow-on editions that will be released as chapters come online.\n\nYou can join the conversation, and keep up to date with events in the #te-book channel of the Token Engineering Academy server [here](https://discord.gg/TDuq49475C):\n\n[Join the Token Engineering Discord Server!](https://discord.gg/TDuq49475C)\n\n## Impact Pirates\n\nImpact Pirates is an open source ecosystem co-creation game for connecting ecovillages and coastal ecovillages to oceanic regenerative stations like kelp farming, regenerative farming, forest stewardship to [create more CO2 sinks and actively avoid CO2](https://drawdown.org/drawdown-framework).\n\nParticipants playfully learn about [Token Engineering](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/) and [Ecosystem Valueflows course content](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-tmg1-ecosystem/) in a game-based framework, which we call [Electric Circus](https://freeel.io/workshops#rpg). Playing and building\_games helps people understand complex systems—including their own systems of thinking.\n\n[Electric Circus proudly presents Impact Pirates | Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1638/electric-circus-proudly-presents-impact-pirates)\n\nYou can join the Impact Pirates channel within the Enlivening Value Flows discord [here](https://discord.com/channels/929391167265710080/931654277053689907):\n\n[Discord - A New Way to Chat with Friends & Communities](https://discord.com/channels/929391167265710080/931654277053689907)\n\n"
