    text: "## Seed Curator\n\nAs someone who has been contributing to Token Engineering in its transdisciplinary fields, you can choose to contribute by sharing your expertise with our Library learners. To start curating:\n\n1.  **Decide where you would like to\_**[**focus your curation on**](/seed-curations)**:**\n\na. You can choose which petal/area of the crypto-economic flower.\n\nb. You can create an original curation focus, with an underlying principle or theory that links together several crypto-economic patterns or disciplines.\n\n[Cryptoeconomics Foundations Paper](https://epub.wu.ac.at/7309/8/Foundationsundefined20Cryptoeconomic%20Systems.pdf), by S. Voshmigr and M. Zargham\n\n2. Add resources directly related to the area you have chosen. These could be academic papers, blog posts, excerpts from books, videos etc.\n\na. You can choose to add your own content.\n\nb. You can also choose to add others’ content.\n\nFor both a and b, we encourage that you include a curator’s explanation on why you think those resources are important. Try to keep the number of your resources chosen between 5 and 10 (we know, it’ll be hard!).\n\n3.  If you are already leading a **learning session** within your online groups which you think may be a great addition for the library’s goal and a great resource for all token engineers, please \\*\\*add it on the\_\\*\\*[**library learning calendar**](https://www.notion.so/62f92f29e6264f4889070c91eac44852).\n\n4.\_**Save your seed curation. You are one of the first!**\n\n## Community Curator\n\nIf you’re relatively new to Token Engineering, you can still become a curator. To start curating:\n\n1.  **Choose an area of focus from the Seed Curations.**\n\n2.  **Read through the material**, and **share your feedback** in the comments section of the focus you have chosen. This helps our Seed Curators clarify the ideas they are trying to communicate in a manner that is easily understandable by people of all technical levels.\n\n## Ethics Participatory Research\n\n...\n\n## Omega Working Group\n\n...\n\n## Token Engineering Advisor\n\n...\n\n## Omega Bounties\n\n...\n\n***\n\nBecome part of focus groups that hold bi-weekly sensema\n\n1- **As a seed curator** (i.e. someone who has been contributing to Token Engineering in its transdisciplinary fields)\n\nThe resources you pick and annotations you provide are immensely valuable to see the connection and how we came to call this Token Engineering\n\nYou might pick a petal of the cryptoeconomics flower, or create a unique curation that tags the resources into one or more of the cryptoeconomic patterns.\n\nFeel free to share resources that helped shape your transdisciplinary stance in Token Engineering, and how it has helped to make sense of this paradigm shifts.\n\n2- **As community curator** (i.e. someone relatively new to Token Engineering)\n\n3- **Design** logos, images for the library. (can be in dework bounties)\n\n4- Or **anything** you believe that can benefit our community. (can be in dework bounties)\n\nYou can take a look at Library Dashboard to find already existing tasks that are suitable to your abilities and interests → [TE Consilience Library Dashboard](/tasks)\n"
