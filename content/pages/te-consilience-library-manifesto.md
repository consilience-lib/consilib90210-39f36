      TE Consilience Library Manifesto
    subtitle: ABSTRACT
    text: >+
      The **T.E. Consilience Initiative** is an 0mega-led project that intends
      to create a 3-phased, multidisciplinary library that synthesizes relevant
      knowledge for the integral development of cryptoeconomic systems. As shown
      in the image below, the 8 domains that the library will draw content from
      are:


      *   Industrial & Systems Engineering


      *   AI, Optimization & Control Theory


      *   Computer Science & Cryptography


      *   Psychology & Decision Science


      *   Political Science & Governance


      *   Philosophy, Law & Ethics


      *   Economics & Game Theory


      *   Operations Research & Management Science

      Throughout these three phases, subject-matter experts (SMEs) and
      contributors will curate selection of resources as a journey with the
      subject that they are curating in our online library.


      **GOALS**


      1.  To create a global repository of valuable ***multidisciplinary
      knowledge*** so as to foster an uniform understanding of topics critical
      to the token engineering discipline.


      2.  To pick the brains of the brightest minds of the web3 space, distill
      the knowledge that they deem most valuable for their peers, and share this
      wisdom through our library portal.


      3.  To curate content into a library product that, besides being free and
      open-source, can also serve as a future funding source for 0mega’s Working
      Group (WG) activities (i.e. through *fundraise and NFT drops*)


      **SUMMARY**


      The [current funding
      proposal](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/te-consilience-library-an-0mega-wg-initiative/751),
      if passed, will cover the funding needs for \*\*\*\*the **first phase** of
      the initiative, where SME contributors will curate book summaries from
      texts of their choice. In the **second phase**, we will open the library
      to public contributions. Also, we will reward quality contributions at
      that stage. If the library is liked by the community we will initiate
      **phase three** which will bring further development in UX such as dynamic
      NFT profiles.


      ### **DEEP DIVE**


      **Phase 1**


      TE Consilience Library V1.0:


      TE Consilience Library will be a crowdsourced, curated database of
      knowledge under the Venn diagram of disciplines related to crypto economic
      systems engineering. In the beginning of our library we will have ‘seed
      curations’ from subject matter experts that will collect 5 to 10 articles.
      Each curation will be about one panel of the crypto economics flower which
      presents the multidisciplinary characteristics of the crypto economics. We
      will request them to justify how their selection would enrich our
      understanding of the topic. Those initial curators are called “seed
      curators” because while we are developing the library (we examined our
      roadmap below), we wanted to create a library where any person can share
      the knowledge that they find valuable. We wanted to create a library that
      does not have a technocratic structure and will respect the value of
      different perspectives. As our long discussion in the 0mega working group
      suggests, we believe in the value of the wisdom of the crowd and the
      contextuality of perspective. For example, we argue that an environmental
      economist who just joined crypto space can bring new valuable perspectives
      with her novel understanding and journey of the subject. In this stage we
      will set our notion library structure, write our manifesto and our
      contributor’s guideline. Also, we will coordinate with curators and create
      “seed” curator’s writing collections.


      ***Outcome of the first phase:*** We will have a library on Notion which
      has curations on the topics from crypto economics flower by subject matter
      experts.


      **Phase 2**


      ***After the seeding phase:***


      After the initial seed phase of 3 months we will open the library to
      public curations. Our librarians will check the content coming from
      outside contributors in terms of appropriateness of contributor 0mega
      guidelines and add curations into the library. At the end of each month we
      will reward some of those curations and increase their visibility. We
      wanted to have a library that is open to public curation because within
      0mega working group we believe in the wisdom of crowds and the
      contextuality of perspectives and knowledge. In other words we believe
      each perspective has its unique value that can propel us forward.


      If the library achieves significant success and is loved by the community,
      we plan to take one more step to create a more engaging library.


      **Outcome of the second phase**: At the end of phase 2 we will have a
      library that has curations from subject matter experts and community
      contribution with a rewarding system for the high quality community
      contribution.


      **Phase 3**


      ***TE Consilience Library V2.0***:


      At this stage things are getting even more exciting ! In Library V2.0 we
      plan to incorporate Dynamic NFT Profiles to assign expertise badges and
      reputation points for visitors and curators. The reputation points will be
      used for “upvoting” selected curations of the library and guide open
      source publications in the wider space following advice and community
      feedback. The 0mega WG plans to initiate Phase 3 according to the
      community’s demand for further development in the library.


      **CONTEXT**


      In ‘Consilience: the Unity of Knowledge’, biologist [E.O.
      Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.\_O.\_Wilson) suggests that
      different avenues of evidence could link together to create a common
      groundwork of explanation in the search for human wisdom. [Wilber’s
      Integral
      theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_\(Ken_Wilber\)#All_Quadrants_All_Levels)
      on the other hand, tries to draw together an already existing number of
      separate paradigms into an interrelated network of approaches that are
      mutually enriching


      Token engineering is an emerging discipline in the overlap between the
      social institution of engineering and web3 token ecosystems. [As with any
      emerging
      technology](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/engineering-ethics-in-web3-18d981278018),
      there is still a lot of uncertainty around the practice but it is already
      clear that these systems are deeply entangled with social and economic
      systems.


      However, while
      [cryptoeconomics](https://assets.pubpub.org/sy02t720/31581340240758.pdf)
      is interdisciplinary by nature, it has so far predominantly been developed
      in the computer science community. The economic assumptions made and
      methods used in most existing protocols are rather limited compared with
      the existing body of relevant literature. There is still much room to
      incorporate methods from various economic disciplines.


      Given all of the above, and after having conducted participatory research
      group discussions, examining the ethos of ethics in token engineering, as
      well as the shared vision and diversity of its communities, building a
      crowd-sourced curated library is relevant to the task at hand and to the
      whole TE community.


      **FAQs**


      ***How does this proposal benefit the community and/or the field of Token
      Engineering?***


      With the TE Consilience Library, the TE community will benefit from a
      helpful and handy interdisciplinary handbook. This also will incentivise
      newcomers and established experts to appreciate the interrelational fabric
      of the token engineering discipline, ultimately allowing some overlooked
      disciplines (such as ethics) in crypto economic systems to emerge. Through
      an holistic approach the library would help researchers and newcomers to
      understand complexities of crypto economics.


      With the starting of the second phase the library will incorporate
      different perspectives about the multidisciplinary aspect of token
      engineering. This will enrich the library’s knowledge base with many
      different contextual perspectives, consequently it will create an
      excellent source for multidisciplinary research on cryptoeconomics.


      Even though it’s still too early to say, a web3 project with these
      characteristics has got potential to galvanise adjacent “knowledge-based”
      communities in the space eager to join forces around a common objective
      (i.e. [The Consilience Project 2](https://consilienceproject.org/), [Game
      B](https://www.game-b.org/), Linked Open Wisdom Commons, Emerge).
