      Token Engineering is an emerging discipline and the pattern of practice is
      still emerging. The TE Consilience Library is a crowdsourced, curated
      database of knowledge under the Venn diagram of disciplines related to
      crypto economic systems engineering.


      We believe in the value of the wisdom of the crowd and the contextuality
      of perspective. For this reason, this *first iteration* of our library is
      sourced by subject matter experts, our [seed
      curators](https://www.notion.so/How-to-Contribute-8128601bf71543e68f84be48e237cadc).
      They collect articles relevant to an area of the crypto-economic flower,
      that they feel will enrich our understanding of the topic.

      [TE Consilience Library Manifesto
      ](https://www.notion.so/TE-Consilience-Library-Manifesto-cccda57eec194517ab26c55ed883d7d5)


      We recommend learning from resources from all areas of the crypto-economic
      flower in order to gain knowledge from multiple perspectives.


      ## Learn together


      In order to make your learning experience easier and more fun, you can
      form [learning
      groups](https://www.notion.so/942f044598924024a80b17fcbf89df3b) to help
      each other become more successful. Within these learning groups, you can:


      *   help answer each others’ questions and help each other get unstuck


      *   share research and learnings with each other


      *   give each other feedback on your projects


      You group will also be paired with a practicing Token Engineer as an
      advisor who can help you by answering questions, clarifying excerpts from
      the resources, give you feedback and share learnings from their experience
      as a Token Engineer.


      Form groups
      [here](https://www.notion.so/942f044598924024a80b17fcbf89df3b).

      ## More ways to learn


      To complement your learning journey within the TE Consilience Library, we
      have created a calendar full of events where you have more opportunities
      to learn from all the communities collaborating on building the emerging
      practice of Token Engineering.


      Find the calendar
      [here](https://www.notion.so/62f92f29e6264f4889070c91eac44852).




      There are also more learning opportunities from the initiatives of the
      Token Engineering comminities that you can take advantage of
